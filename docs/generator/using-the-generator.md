### Shorthand generate commands

Shorthand commands give you the option to skip the prompt, it will also not generate imports in `_globals.js` files \(for component, directive, filters and mixins\), for views will it skip the route generator as wel.

**Using Shorthand commands**

```text
yarn make --<type> [<name>]  
```

**Examples:**

```bash
# Generate component
yarn make --component button 
```

```bash
# Generate view
yarn make --view contact 
```

```bash
# Generate store
yarn make --store products 
```

```bash
# Generate filter
yarn make --filter uppercase 
```

```bash
# Generate directive
yarn make --directive focus 
```

```bash
# Generate mixin
yarn make --mixin scrollTo 
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
When using the shorthand command it will generate by using the default settings. By generating a view it skips the route generation.
{% endhint %}
