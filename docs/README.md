# Vue Structure

Vue structure offers a project structure for the average Vue project that can scale-up, features Vuex and Vue router. It's made following the: [Airbnb Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) and [Vue Style Guide](https://vuejs.org/v2/style-guide/).
Because Vue self doesn't guide you about structuring projects, Vue Structure gives you the structure to develop in.

## Quick installation

``` sh
vue create --preset ericfennis/vue-structure {my-project}
```
